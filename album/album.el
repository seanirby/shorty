;; This is a basic album file which defines an album association list.
;; It may look weird but it's analogous to a json object.
;;
;; Albums must have a `:playlists' property which points to a list of playlist.
;; Similarly, each of these playlists has a `:demos' property which points to a list of demos.
;;
;; Each of the entities described above may have properties defined on them.
;; I've provided comments on the lines below with a description of each property.
;; Comments starting with '*' below indicate mandatory properties.
;;
;; The properties `:minor-modes' and `:text' may be used at any entity level.
;; The innermost value found is what is used for a particular demo.
;;
;; The `:text-refs' property define keywords that may be used as the value for a `:text' property.
;; A text-ref should point to a filepath relative to the album file that contains the necessary text.
;; `:text-refs' should only be defined at the album root level.
;;
;; At the playlist and demo level, the `:text' property can be either a text-ref keyword or a literal string.
